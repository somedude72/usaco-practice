## USACO

This repository's purpose is to document my journey of practicing USACO problems and competeing in contests. 

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured into divisions, which is further divided into different difficulties of problems as well as a `Contest` folder which contains the previous USACO contests that I've participated in. 

Each problem folder contains an executable binary (compiled on macOS with clang++), as well as the source code. In each source file, there will be a heading formatted like below...

```cpp
/*
USACO [DIVISION] [YEAR]: [TITLE] [DIFFICULTY]
[LINK TO PROBLEM]
*/
```

...that gives context to the problem.

Additionally, each source file for the problems done during the contest will contain the results during the contest, where a checkmark represents a passed test case, and a cross represents a wrong answer or time limit exceeded.
