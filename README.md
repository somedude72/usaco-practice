## USACO

This repository's purpose is to document my journey of practicing USACO problems and completing in contests. 

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured into divisions, which is further divided into different difficulties of problems as well as a `contest` folder which contains the previous USACO contests that I've participated in. 

Each problem folder contains the source code where there will be a heading in each of the source code files formatted like below...

```cpp
/*
USACO [DIVISION] [YEAR]: [TITLE] [DIFFICULTY]
[LINK TO PROBLEM]
*/
```

...that gives context to the problem.

Additionally, each source file for the problems done during the contest will contain the results during the contest, where a checkmark represents a passed test case, and a cross represents a wrong answer or time limit exceeded.
